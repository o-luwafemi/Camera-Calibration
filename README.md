# Camera-Calibration


Camera calibration is performed to determine a camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, optical center, and lens distortion), as well as the extrinsic parameters (translation vector and rotation matrix). This was done using OpevCV library to enable accurate 3D measurements and computer vision applications.

The process uses multiple images (recommended 10) of a known calibration pattern, such as a chessboard, captured from various angles.
